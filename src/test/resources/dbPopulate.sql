An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could execute arbitrary code and take control of an     affected system. An attacker could then install     programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new     accounts with full user rights.

An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve     the memory address of a kernel object.  (CVE-2018-0746,     CVE-2018-0747)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in     Windows Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD.dll) when     it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could potentially read data that was not intended to be     disclosed. Note that this vulnerability would not allow     an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user     rights directly, but it could be used to obtain     information that could be used to try to further     compromise the affected system.  (CVE-2018-0754)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     the scripting engine handles objects in memory in     Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt     memory in such a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n    (CVE-2018-0762, CVE-2018-0772)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Kernel API enforces permissions. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could impersonate processes, interject cross-process     communication, or interrupt system functionality.\n    (CVE-2018-0748, CVE-2018-0751, CVE-2018-0752)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Server when an     attacker with valid credentials attempts to open a     specially crafted file over the SMB protocol on the same     machine. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could bypass certain security checks in     the operating system.  (CVE-2018-0749)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that     Windows handles objects in memory. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause a     target system to stop responding. Note that the denial     of service condition would not allow an attacker to     execute code or to elevate user privileges. However, the     denial of service condition could prevent authorized     users from using system resources.
